Ideas on how to improve the model:

      Add "is_october" at minimum, and perhaps other months or groups of months.

      Add accumulation/distribution line.

      Add relative strength index.

      Did I do anything with volume trend in the "close" stock?

      Add candlestick features, e.g.,
          - % change between open and close
	  - % change between high and low
	  - bullish or bearish candlestick
	  - degree of bullishness or bearishness (maybe this is % change between open and close)
	  - patterns observed in the harmonic trading book
	  - differences between low and close and high and close
	  - differences between low and open and high and open

	  - several of these might come to the same thing...
